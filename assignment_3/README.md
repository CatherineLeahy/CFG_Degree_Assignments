# Assignment 3 - Data & MySQL :bar_chart:

The goal of this assignment was to design and implement a database that solves a problem. The scenario chosen is a 
neighbourhood allotment that requires a platform to manage:

- :droplet:Record when a plant has been watered, fertilised, pruned, or harvested
- :mag_right:Monitor growing plot usage and search for available plots
