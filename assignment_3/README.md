# Assignment 3 - Data & MySQL :bar_chart:

## Introduction :herb:
The goal of this assignment was to design and implement a database that solves a problem. The scenario chosen is a 
neighbourhood allotment that requires a platform to manage: 
- :seedling:Plant inventory
- :handshake:Shared growing plots
- :calendar:Scheduling plant care

## Neighbourhood Allotment Platform :computer:
### Scenario
The neighbourhood currently relies on manual records and email chains for its allotment administration, 
resulting in poor coordination and difficulty tracking plant care. The neighbourhood needs to be able to: 
- :memo:Store and update neighbour details such as names and email addresses
- :droplet:Record when a plant has been watered, fertilised, pruned, or harvested
- :mag_right:Monitor growing plot usage and search for available plots
