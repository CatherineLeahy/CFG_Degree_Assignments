# Assignment 2 - Python :snake:

## Introduction :rocket:
The goal of this assignment was to create a console app that interacts with an API to obtain data. I chose to use a
recipe API, Edamam. 

## Recipe Generator App :plate_with_cutlery:
This app provides the user with recipes based on ingredients they input, giving the output recipe in
a markdown file. Follow instructions provided in the command line. 

## API Key and ID :key:
To utilise the app, an API key and ID are required. My personal key and ID are included in the python code, as per 
Ismail's request on slack. If you would like to acquire your own personal key and ID, please create an account on 
Edamam: https://www.edamam.com/. Your key and ID will be available via the applications tab of your account. Add your
key and ID to lines 8 and 9 of the python code and you're ready to go!
